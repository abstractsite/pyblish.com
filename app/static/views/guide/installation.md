# Installation

The best way to learn anything is to try things out.

```bash
# Pyblish is available via pip
$ pip install pyblish
```

To test things out, let's try and import our newly installed package.

```python
>>> import pyblish
>>> pyblish.version
'1.0.15'
```

The next few sections cover some in-depth details about Pyblish, but if you'd rather get your feet wet with publishing within Autodesk Maya, head on down to [Publishing](/guide/publishing) to get started!
