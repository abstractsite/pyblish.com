# FAQ

> Is this similar to project X?

By project X, you might be referring to other pipeline-related projects such as Shotgun, FTrack, 5th Kind, Tactic or even the newly announced Redcurrant. Pyblish wouldn't dream of such great endeavours and instead focuses on a very minimal mission of quality assuring outgoing data from digital content creation software. Other projects are better suited at organising and event-handling.
